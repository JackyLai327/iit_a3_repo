            <p class="content">Most members attended the group meetings and contributed ideas to the game making itself as well as risks, aims and goals. However, we do need some of our group members to be more proactive in listening to the recordings if they were unable to catch up to speed and hence be able to contribute. We also should have started on this assignment a little earlier than we did to avoid such stress. It was surprising that we were able to complete this assignment within 2 ½ weeks! Group work requires communication, patience, understanding and most of all, responsibility.</p>

            <p class="content">Assignment 3 was a bit confusing for me at first. Even though I found GB Studio and decided to present it as a software to use for our prototype, it was hard for me to understand the limitations of the software. I couldn’t design my own title screen and instead had to follow the pre-built palettes and elements available in the game. Eventually Kelvin and Jacky told me that we had to build a map using Tiled, a different software, but it was hard for me to understand how to use that application too. Overall, this assignment has made me appreciate how hard it actually is to design a game. The creative process and storyline of a game required a lot of teamwork.</p>

            <p class="content">I was very lucky to have most of my group members be very responsible in completing their various assigned tasks each week. It definitely made my job a lot easier as I could log onto the google docs every day to edit things and make clarifications each time we had our group meetings. One thing I could have done more is perhaps to listen in more on the game prototype making as that is part of the assignment afterall. It was a challenge to combine all the game related points into paragraphs when I was not familiar with many of the terms, but that is exactly how I learned more about the game prototype making. It surprised me that we were able to come up with a working game prototype in such a short span of 2 ½ weeks! Teamwork and communication are so important for group assignments.</p>

            <p class="content">Everyone was enthusiastic about the production of the game and have worked very hard to contribute to the project. I could have improved by making more active contributions to the coding of the game production. Through this time, I learned the process of game production and about the required personnel and tools and how to divide labour. It was a very worthwhile experience to see a group work together to accomplish so much in such a short amount of time.</p>

            <p class="content">Assignment 3 was challenging and required a lot of work and effort for everyone. I am glad to be a part of this project. I wish I could have contributed more but it was hard as I have had no experience with IT, though it was very interesting to listen in on the game making process. Things I have learned in participating in the group project are communication, organisation, IT language and what goes into game production. Groups are great because we all have our own responsibilities and more helping hands so that it is not so stressful.</p>
            <p class="heading-2">Kelvin</p>
            <p class="content">Assignment 3 was a lot of fun for me, I was able to delve into my creative side and create sprites and assets for the game. Furthermore, my seemingly useless knowledge of the video game industry actually proved to be useful here. My original ideas for the game were rather ambitious and outside of the scope and timeframe of the assignment. But we were able to come up with a happy medium using programs and tools that were more accessible and also free. I hope to be able to continue this project on the side as a passion project of mine. One thing I learned about groups is that as long as we communicate, things go a lot smoother.</p>
            <p class="heading-2">Yu-Cheng</p>
            <p class="content">We procrastinated much less than we did on assignment 3. For this one, most of us contributed a lot and completed our tasks on time. The game developers are really passionate about making the prototype work and it was really fun to create a game boy style game prototype. We have learned a lot more about conditions in programming and what we could potentially implement in future programming. As for the website, I have improved a lot in HTML5 and CSS3. Teamwork in groups means that everyone has and fulfils each of their assigned tasks. We definitely could have started earlier for this assignment instead of procrastinating.</p>
