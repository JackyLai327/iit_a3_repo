            <p class="heading-1">Risks</p>
            <p class="content">As we make more progress into the actual game making (beyond the prototype), more functions and details are implemented as C++ has much less restrictions and limitations than GB studio. However, there are many risks especially since we have not been trained in C++.  When creating a horror shooter game, we need to fully consider the logical background, or the rationales behind things such as our plot. An unrealistic plot or environment may reduce the usersâ€™ desire to continue playing.</p>
            <p class="content">Another risk to consider are game bugs. At all stages of a game's development, it is at risk of having game bugs. Therefore, testing is essential. Game verification is carried out at all stages of the production process in order to find various flaws and glitches. There are a variety of game testing methods that allow developers to test for bugs (Testbytes, 2017):</p>
            <ul>
                <li class="content">
                    <p class="content">Exploratory testing: To discover glitches and flaws, game developers play the game in the same way as normal users do. Different testers use different methods and approaches to play the game, which assists in the discovery of glitches or errors.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="content">
                    <p class="content">Break the rules: When checking, do not use the same number of instructions every time. Extend the reach of test cases to discover possible flaws or errors, and experiment with various approaches to reach the same performance.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="content">
                    <p class="content">Use an unusual method: Play the game in the wrong order or inappropriately, such as missing any moves or not completing some acts, to see the results.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="content">
                    <p class="content">Use all functions at all times: Try to use all functions at all times, even though they aren't necessary at the time.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="content">
                    <p class="content">Experiment with items that aren't authorized: At various locations, quickly press buttons. Retrace your steps and review the outcome before completing the stage.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="content">
                    <p class="content">Examine the effects: Try spending time with the smallest possible inputs or user activity. Accordingly, explore playing games with the highest possible inputs. Analyze the effect of walking through walls, barriers, or objects.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="content">Running such tests will give us information about how the system performs under high loads. Our game development team will take these into consideration however given our time and skill sets are limited, not all of these tests will be conducted.</p>
