            <p class="content">The production of a game requires months if not years involving many individuals with the skill sets to do so. Since this is the first time any of us has developed a game, and with the limited amount of time, we have to set out some priorities and limits. Itâ€™s important to accept that there will be some features that are beyond our skill sets, that we only have 3 weeks to make this game and that we do not have access to costly game development software. Our scope for this project is to create a 1 level prototype with 4 maps, a short and simple storyline, a few enemies in each map, established attack systems, and players will have a HP value. Game animations such as the characters and maps are made using Aseprite and Tiled. GB studio is also limited in terms of making more refined character movements, frame rate and player controls. We also intend to use pre-made music from the internet instead of creating our own.</p>
