            <p class="heading-2">What Our Project Will Do</p>
            <p class="content">Our project consists of creating a horror game that can be played on multiple devices. It is a top-down shooter game where the player shoots its enemies in order to escape and move on to the next stage. The player has a HP value which will decrease every time it takes a hit from an enemy. These enemies are zombie-like figures that approach the player from multiple directions and are littered throughout the map.</p>
            <p class="content">We will create a fun immersive storyline where the player starts off chopping some wood, after which a branch falls and knocks the player out. When the player ‘wakes up’ in an unfamiliar part of the forest, he is surrounded by enemies determined to turn the player into a zombie. The goal is to defeat these enemies and the ‘final’ boss in order to return to the players original life which includes their home, family and kids. However, the final boss is not demonstrated in the prototype, the final map is where the guards warn the player about the final boss.</p>

            <p class="heading-2">How To Do It</p>
            <p class="content">Like mentioned in our goals above, the initial part of our game making process includes planning out our storyline as well as experimenting with various pixel art styles and game prototyping. This is key for the development process so as to explore modifications to make the game more appealing storyline and animation wise. Aseprite allows us to build valuable characters, objects, tools, and customize animations. Game prototyping also allows us to discover interface and mechanical problems that could arise if not addressed early on.</p>
            <p class="content">We have decided to use GB studio which is a game boy game maker for prototyping. Due to our choice of game development software, our prototype does not contain colours, only can move in four directions. We are also unable to create our own functions or behaviours as they are pre-made and limited in the software engine itself.</p>
            <p class="content">The main purpose of choosing to make a simple prototype is so we can make a short playable game in the short amount of time given to test out the plotline, functionalities of top-down shooter and our AI enemies. After creating the prototype, we will begin coding with C++ in Unity due to its more powerful engine and flexibility. While coding the program, we will also aim to create graphics and soundtracks if we have the time to do so. We will also add various levels to the game and create a more elaborate plotline to make it more realistic and immersive.</p>

            <hr>

            <p class="heading-2">How Far Have We Got</p>
            <p class="content">We have created our prototype and it is now playable with 1 stage with 4 maps, a short storyline, established attack systems and players have a HP value. AI enemies that were created have the capacity to approach and attack the player. Players can also choose between male and female avatars. In regard to the environment, there are 4 different maps which contain enemies that look different but attack in the same way and have the same strength. Maps also have different layouts. We have also included sample background music from the internet but will aim to create our own in the 10 weeks given after this as we lack the time and expertise to create one from scratch now.</p>

            <p class="heading-2">How It Has Progressed</p>
            <p class="content">The game developers (Nayli, Yu-Cheng and Kelvin) had to first learn how to use GB studio. GB studio is much easier than Unity with its extensive usage of C++ and hence appropriate for game prototyping at the beginning. They then created graphics such as map tilesets and character sprites, which were achieved using a licensed program called Aseprite. Aseprite was a useful tool as it was designed primarily for pixel art, as long as we had chosen the correct colour palette for our intended platform everything should run smoothly. Shooter and AI enemies are then put into pace holders where we add in functionalities. We also took note of all the issues while prototyping and searched for demonstrations and solutions online including our first stage of debugging.</p>

            <hr>

            <p class="heading-2">Dead Ends and Decisions</p>
            <p class="content">There were no dead-ends per se since we merely developed a prototype, but it was challenging.</p>
            <p class="content">Creating AI was challenging as the robots need to know when and what to do under certain circumstances. We were also limited to simple actions such as simply allowing the player to move up, down, left or right instead of detailed actions such as dodging enemies.</p>
            <p class="content">Creating player animation and graphics is time consuming and requires skills, however we managed to create our very own unique animations using Aseprite and Tiled.</p>
            <p class="content">A combat system requires many different features storing different values such as HP, items and such. This requires high-level Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) skills to achieve which is not within our skillset. Therefore, our prototype only incorporates simple HP values.</p>
            <p class="content">In addition, the design process of the game is limited as GB Studio doesn’t allow a user to design the map or edit the text of the game. Initially, we had created a pixel style image which to incorporate into the game as an opening/ending screen but unfortunately GB studio does not support that function.</p>

            <img src="images/title_2.png" class="smaller_screenshot">
            <p class="content"><i>images we intended to include into the game</i></p>

            <p class="content">To overcome this obstacle, we decided to use a different software, Tiled to create a map for the game.</p>
            <p class="content">Due to the simplicity of GB studio, movement of the player is limited to 4 directions, and we were unable to apply the player status bar on the top screen. It was also very difficult to create and edit the game together using GB studio as collaboration is not a function. Therefore, we split off into our own tasks to add into the game.</p>
